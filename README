In order to compile each file, use:

$ make filename

In order to run each file, use:

$ ./filename

For any arguments, simply use '-' and then the argument (i.e. ./ls -a)

If there is more than one argument, please put them together (i.e. ./ls -la)
instead of putting them apart (i.e. ./ls -l -a)

When specifying a directory in the arguments, please be sure to put a '/' at
the end of the pathname. (i.e. ./ls /home/ugrads/everage/ )
